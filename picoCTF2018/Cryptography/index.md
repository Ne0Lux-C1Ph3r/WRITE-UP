<h3>Crypto Warmup 1 - Points: 75</h3>
Crpyto can often be done by hand, here's a message you got from a friend, llkjmlmpadkkc with the key of thisisalilkey. Can you use this table to solve it?.

``` shell
Flag:

<h3>Crypto Warmup 2 - Points: 75</h3>
Cryptography doesn't have to be complicated, have you ever heard of something called rot13? cvpbPGS{guvf_vf_pelcgb!} 

``` shell

<h3>HEEEEEEERE'S Johnny! - Points: 100</h3>
Okay, so we found some important looking files on a linux computer. Maybe they can be used to get a password to the process. Connect with nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 5221. Files can be found here: passwd shadow. 

``` shell
Flag: 
```

<h3>caesar cipher 1 - Points: 150</h3>
This is one of the older ciphers in the books, can you decrypt the message? You can find the ciphertext in /problems/caesar-cipher-1_1_6fbf7a9ce0aac23bab1c37836cc20c3b on the shell server. 

``` shell
Flag: 
```

<h3>hertz - Points: 150</h3>
Here's another simple cipher for you where we made a bunch of substitutions. Can you decrypt it? Connect with nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 43324.  

``` shell
Flag: 
```

<h3>blaise's cipher - Points: 200</h3>
My buddy Blaise told me he learned about this cool cipher invented by a guy also named Blaise! Can you figure out what it says? Connect with nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 11281. 

``` shell
Flag: 
```

<h3>hertz 2 - Points: 200</h3>
This flag has been encrypted with some kind of cipher, can you decrypt it? Connect with nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 39961. 

``` shell
Flag: 
```

<h3>caesar cipher 2 - Points: 250</h3>
Can you help us decrypt this message? We believe it is a form of a caesar cipher. You can find the ciphertext in /problems/caesar-cipher-2_4_23c82ed24f4436e96acc1f9f22dc8799 on the shell server. 

``` shell
Flag: 
```

<h3>rsa-madlibs - Points: 250</h3>
We ran into some weird puzzles we think may mean something, can you help me solve one? Connect with nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 36859

``` shell
Flag: 
```

<h3>Safe RSA - Points: 250</h3>
Now that you know about RSA can you help us decrypt this ciphertext? We don't have the decryption key but something about those values looks funky.. 

``` shell
Flag: 
```

<h3>Super Safe RSA - Points: 350</h3>
Dr. Xernon made the mistake of rolling his own crypto.. Can you find the bug and decrypt the message? Connect with nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 59208. 

``` shell
Flag: 
```

<h3>Super Safe RSA 2 - Points: 450</h3>
Wow, he made the exponent really large so the encryption MUST be safe, right?! Connect with nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 29483.
