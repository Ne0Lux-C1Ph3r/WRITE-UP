Crypto Vigenere with key FLAG

It is interesting how in history people often receive credit for things they did not create 
During the course of history, the Vigenère Cipher has been reinvented many times
It was falsely attributed to Blaise de Vigenère as it was originally described in 1553 by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his book La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso
For the implementation of this cipher a table is formed by sliding the lower half of an ordinary alphabet for an apparently random number of places with respect to the upper half picoCTF{b311a50_0r_v1gn3r3_c1ph3r0e4df52f} 
The first well-documented description of a polyalphabetic cipher however, was made around 1467 by Leon Battista Alberti.
The vigenère Cipher is therefore sometimes called the Alberti Disc or Alberti Cipher.
In 1508, Johannes Trithemius invented the so-called tabula recta (a matrix of shifted alphabets) that would later be a critical component of the Vigenère Cipher.
Bellaso’s second booklet appeared in 1555 as a continuation of the first. The lower halves of the alphabets are now shifted 
regularly, but the alphabets and the index letters are mixed by means of a mnemonic key phrase, which can be different with each 
correspondent.

Having had some time at my disposal when in london, i had visited the british museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country. i find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, transylvania, moldavia and bukovina, in the midst of the carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of europe. i was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the castle dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own ordnance survey maps; but i found that bistritz, the post town named by count dracula, is a fairly well-known place. i shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when i talk over my travels with mina.
