<h3>13 - Points: 100</h3>
Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}

``` shell

<h3>Easy1 - Points: 100</h3>
The one time pad can be cryptographically secure, but not when you know the key. Can you solve this? We've given you the encrypted flag, key, and a table to help UFJKXQZQUNB with the key of SOLVECRYPTO. Can you use this table to solve it?. 

``` shell
Flag: picoCTF{}
